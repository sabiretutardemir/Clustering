#Clustering Algorithms and Dimensionality Reduction Techniques

Repository Overview

Welcome to the Clustering Algorithms and Dimensionality Reduction Techniques repository! ðŸŽ‰ This repository serves as a comprehensive exploration of clustering techniques, feature engineering, and dimensionality reduction methods, with practical implementations and comparisons.

What You Will Find Here:

Clustering Algorithms

K-Means Clustering: A simple yet powerful algorithm to group data based on distance from centroids.

DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise): An algorithm that identifies dense regions of data and separates them into clusters.

Agglomerative Clustering: A hierarchical clustering approach that builds clusters by merging data points based on similarity.

Dimensionality Reduction Techniques

PCA (Principal Component Analysis): A linear technique to reduce dimensions while retaining variance.

t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding): A nonlinear method for visualizing high-dimensional data.

UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection): An advanced algorithm for visualization and dimension reduction with a focus on local structures.

Feature Engineering

Techniques to preprocess and transform data for better clustering results, including encoding, scaling, and binning features.

Model Evaluation and Comparison

Evaluation metrics such as:

WCSS (Within-Cluster Sum of Squares)

Silhouette Score

Calinski-Harabasz Index

Side-by-side comparison of clustering algorithms with and without dimensionality reduction.

Goals

The primary aim of this repository is to:

Demonstrate the application of various clustering techniques.

Explore how dimensionality reduction methods can enhance clustering results.

Showcase practical feature engineering for real-world datasets.

Provide a detailed comparison of models to guide users in selecting the best approach for their datasets.
